# LlamaCloud Parsing Review

This repo contains a hands-on review of **LlamaCloud's document parsing** capabilities, across different parsing modes.

I tested Google's 10-K Report (2024) under:
- Cost-effective
- Agentic
- Agentic Plus
- Use-case Presets: Technical Documents
- Use-case Presets: Scientific Papers


This report includes:
- Strengths and limitations observed in parsing outputs
- JSON vs visual fidelity comparisons
- Recommendations for improving structured output

➡️ See full analysis in [`llamacloud_parsing_review.md`](./llamacloud_parsing_review.md)

> Status: Parsing completed (Index and Extract will be tested once credits are available).
